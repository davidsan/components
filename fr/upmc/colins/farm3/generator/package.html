<p>Request Generator</p>

<p>
This package contains the Request Generator component and his dynamic version.
This package also contains all classes affiliated with the Request Generator.
</p>

<p>
The class <code>RequestGenerator</code> implements a component that generates
requests for a service provider in a discrete-event based simulation.
</p>

<p>
A request has a processing time and an arrival process that both follow an
exponential probability distribution. The generation process is started by
executing the method <code>generateNextRequest</code> as a component task. It
generates an instance of the class <code>Request</code>, with a processing
time generated from its exponential distribution, and then schedule its next
run after the interarrival time also generated from its exponential
distribution. To stop the generation process, the method
<code>shutdown</code> uses the future returned when scheduling the next
request generation to cancel its execution.
