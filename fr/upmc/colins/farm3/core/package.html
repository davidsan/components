<p>
This package contains the Core component.
This package also contains all classes affiliated with the Core.

<p>
The core component receives requests to be serviced through an
inbound port implementing the interface <code>RequestArrivalI</code>.  The
discrete-event simulation is based upon three kinds of events:

<ol>
<li>request arrival, upon which the request is queued, and then if the
 server is idle, a begin request processing event is immediately executed;
 </li>
<li>begin request processing, upon which a end request processing event is
 scheduled after a delay given by the request processing time; and,</li>
<li>end request processing, upon which if the queue is not empty a begin
 request processing event is immediately executed</li>
</ol>

Total service times (waiting + processing) of requests is accumulated in the
variable <code>totalServicingTime</code> while the number of serviced
requests is accumulated in the variable
<code>totalNumberOfServicedRequests</code>.  When the component is shut down,
any end processing event already scheduled is cancelled, and the component
outputs the average service time of the completely serviced requests.
